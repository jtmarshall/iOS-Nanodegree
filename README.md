                and play it back with modified sound.

MemeMe - V1: created the base structure of an app that can take a picture, or
              load from memory, and input text on top/bottom to create a meme.
              Then it can be saved and accessed later.
         V2: polishing up V1 with table/collection views that display previously
             created memes. Memes can be shared through media outlets(Facebook),
             and canceling a meme is enabled.
